                a hanging tree, where he was left to die alone in a mire of

                <strong>Gambino</strong> eventually happened upon the grisly

                Gattsu is a man in constant conflict with his own inner darkness
                and his remarkable pain tolerance is due in part to his force of
                will.

              <p>
                Gattsu has been a struggler of the battlefield since the raw age
                of nine, and as such, has had nearly two decades to refine
                himself into the formidable warrior he is. During his days as a
                mercenary in the Hundred-Year War, he became famed for
                single-handedly slaying 100 Tudor soldiers, and even garnered
                the respect of the legendary swordsman Nosferatu Zodd for being
                the first human in three centuries to wound the apostle.

                Though much of his survival is predicated on his sheer
                determination and willpower, Gattsu's life has been littered
                with instances where his survival was largely coincidental. For
                an unspecified amount of time, he is left to die beneath the
                corpse of his hanging mother, yet he still releases a healthy
                cry upon randomly being discovered by Gambino and his
                mercenaries at a later point.

                Having been taught the basics of knife throwing by Judeau,
                Gattsu has acquired remarkable accuracy and precision with them
                over the years. Their effectiveness is dependent upon vital
                points being hit, being of minimal effect against larger foes;
                against smaller targets,

                These are a later addition to Guts' arsenal, fashioned for his
                by Rickert. These small, mine-shaped bombs are remarkably
                powerful for their size, but within a very contained radius,
                usually only killing targets if vital areas are hit. As such,
                they are typically used only to slow down or distract larger
                enemies.

              <p>
                nown for his air of austerity, Gattsu is a gruff, cynical man
                holding an overall bleak outlook on life. This is a consequence
                of enduring waves of suffering and numerous betrayals since his
                youth, as nearly all highlights of his life have, in time,
                become lows. In spite of his guarded, brooding exterior, he
                shows a more easy-going, compassionate side around the people he
                trusts,
              </p>
              <p>
                appearing markedly less unsociable and distant, though still
                retaining his dry candidness. Even as his inner darkness festers
                deep within him and its temptation becomes increasingly harder
                to resist, he retains his empathy and compassion, refusing to
                discard his humanity.
              </p>
              <p>
                In his formative years, Guts is devoid of true purpose in life,
                killing as a child mercenary merely as a means to survive. As a
                blank slate, he often finds himself seeking validation from
                those he respects most, content so long as "one person [looks
                his] way". His precariousness slowly develops into individuality
                upon meeting Griffith – someone whom he eventually seeks to
                stand beside as an equal, rather than be looked down on by. The
                swordsman then embarks on a journey of self-discovery, in which
                he comes to acknowledge his lifelong bond with and passion for
                the sword. Upon realizing this, he begins devoting himself to
                honing his craft and fighting ever stronger adversaries, having
                a newfound purpose in life through this.
              </p>
              <p>
                After surviving the Eclipse, Guts grows vindictive, wanting
                nothing other than to hunt down and slaughter any apostle he
                encounters, and, more importantly, exact revenge on Griffith and
                the God Hand. He leaves behind a regressed Casca for two years
                to embark on his warpath against demon kind. On his two-year
                hunt, Guts becomes largely self-centered and anti-social,
                indifferent to the suffering of others and detesting those whom
                he deems weak. His reclusive nature and hostility toward those
                attempting to connect with him stem from a fear of creating new
                emotional attachments; fear of making precious new companions
                akin to the comrades he lost to the Eclipse. With time, due in
                large part to the efforts of Puck, Guts ceases his solitary
                struggle and solicits the help of fellow travellers, slowly
                fostering new companionship with them. Despite his initial
                apprehension toward displaying affection for his new comrades,
                he comes to appreciate the bonds he makes with them and finds
                himself grateful for having their individual strengths to rely
                on.
              </p>
              <p>
                Above all else, Guts is the personification of perseverance and
                resilience. Through all of his numerous trials and tribulations,
                he has never yielded to the flow of causality and continues to
                subsist against seemingly insurmountable odds. Indeed, Guts is
                an ardent detractor of the idea of destiny, believing his
                actions to ultimately be of his own volition and paying no heed
                to such a supposed certainty.
